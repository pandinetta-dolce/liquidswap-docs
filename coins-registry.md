# Coins Registry

We are developing our own [Coin Registry](https://github.com/pontem-network/coins-registry) file formats for [LiquidSwap](https://liquidswap.com/), which contains all the information about coins and pools in which coins can be exchanged.

Currently, we use two files:

* [coins.json](https://github.com/pontem-network/coins-registry/blob/main/coins.json)
* [pools.json](https://github.com/pontem-network/coins-registry/blob/main/pools.json)

### Coins Data Structure

\
There is a coins list in coins.json. One coin can be presented as follows:

```
{
    "source": "aptos",
    "name": "Aptos Coin",
    "chainId": 1,
    "decimals": 8,
    "symbol": "APT",
    "type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "caution": false,
    "order": 1
}
```

#### Fields Description

`source` - enum data type with strict value check. If you’d like to add the new value into it, fill the form. Usually source is the name of a partner's company to add many coins into the list. We support now following sources:

* `aptos` - for the native Aptos Coin.
* `partners` - for other coins.
* `celer` - for coins provided by Celer.
* `layerzero` - for coins provided by Layer Zero.
* `wormhole` - for coins provided by Wormhole.

`name` - coins' full name. We update this value by a request to the node. It is used on Picture 1 as a bottom string after the dot (on the picture it is Bitcoin).

`chainId` - for mainnet value is 1. Currently, testnet coins stored in the `testnet` branch of this repo.

`decimals` - how many decimals supports your coin. We update this value by a request to the node.

`symbol` - it is used to construct a coin alias, which can be equal to symbol as on Picture 1 in the top string.

`type` - full type of coin. String with following structure ADDRESS::MODULE::COIN, e.g. `0x1000000fa32d122c18a6a31c009ce5e71674f22d06a581bb0a15575e6addadcc::usda::USDA`.

`caution` - if we need to show warning icon near the coin - we will add the caution field.

`order` - order of coin in coins list. Current logic:

```
1 Apt
10 USDC
20 USDT
30 DAI
40 BTC
50 WETH
60 BUSD / BNB
1000 other coins
```

### Pools Data Structure

```
{
    "coinX": "0xf22bede237a07e121b56d91a491eb7bcdfd1f5907926a9e58338f964a01b17fa::asset::USDT",
    "coinY": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "curve": "uncorrelated",
    "networkId": 1
}
```

#### Fields Description

`coinX` - full type of coin. String with following structure ADDRESS::MODULE::COIN, e.g. `0xf22bede237a07e121b56d91a491eb7bcdfd1f5907926a9e58338f964a01b17fa::asset::USDT`.

`coinY` - full type of coin. String with following structure ADDRESS::MODULE::COIN, e.g. `0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin`.

> ⚠️ Coins should be sorted.

`curve` - to strictly point curve type use the following values:

* selectable - will keep switcher for a curve type available for declared coins pair.
* uncorrelated - keep only uncorrelated curve pool on UI.
* stable - keep only stable curve pool on UI.
