The staking paltform itself is available in the [Liquidswap DApp](https://liquidswap.com) in the Hydroponics Farm section.

The UI supports the following features:

* Staking / unstaking
* Harvesting
* NFT-enabled boosting

If you wish to create a new pool or extend an existing pool, please use the deployed [smart contracts](smart-contracts.md) directly.

#### Listing a pool

The dApp contains only whitelisted staking pools. If you wish your staking pool to be included on the list, please [contact us](https://t.me/pontemnetworkchat).
