**The staking is available only on Liquidswap Testnet; once it is released to the mainnet, we will announce it!** :warning:****

The goal of staking developed by the Liquidswap team is to incentivize liquidity providers and reward them with protocol coins: including the protocol ones and 3rd party projects.

Staking is built in a simple manner, but at the same time, our staking is fully permissionless and independent. Therefore, it can be used by other projects to configure and launch their staking pools; it doesn't belong to Liquidswap LP coins, as any coins can be used as a stake and as a reward.

The staking contracts are built in Move language. The key features are:

* The contracts are permissionless: anyone can create a new staking pool.
* Any coins can be used as stake or reward coins.
* NFT can be used as a boost parameter for the pool.
* Rewards can be deposited to a pool at any time and will extend the harvest period.
* Users can unstake their coins without loss of profit at any time after one week since the stake passed or once the harvest period is finished.
* Users can withdraw rewards at any time by harvesting.

Simples way to use staking protocol is [Liquidswap DApp](https://liquidswap.com) or continue with current documentation to learn more about protocol and smart contracts.

### Security audits

The staking contracts were reviewed and audited by Ottersec and Halborn security teams. Once reports are available, we will publish them here.
